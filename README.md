# CV Application

## Description

The application is a mock shopping cart website that allows users to add items to their cart. It keeps track of the details of the items in the cart and calculates the total cost.

## Motivation

The Shopping Cart project is part of my ongoing self-taught education through The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course. The goal of this project was to become more comfortable with the React JS framework and learn how to use React Router.

## Quick Start

```
git clone git@github.com:Afer1991/shopping-cart.git
```

```
cd shopping cart
```

```
npm install
```
